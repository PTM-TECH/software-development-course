      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, in the village of
        Mvezo, South Africa. He grew up in a society deeply divided by race and
        inequality, which later shaped his commitment to justice and human
        rights. After studying law, Mandela became actively involved in the
        African National Congress (ANC), where he worked to challenge the
        apartheid system that enforced racial segregation and discrimination.
        <br />
        In 1994, Nelson Mandela was elected as South Africa’s first Black
        president in the country’s first democratic elections. During his
        presidency, he emphasized reconciliation, forgiveness, and national
        unity, working to heal a nation divided by decades of injustice. Mandela
        passed away on December 5, 2013, but his influence continues to inspire
        people around the world.
